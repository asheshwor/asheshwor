Hello there👋, I’m Asheshwor😊.

Originally for Nepal, I currently reside in Adelaide, Australia with my wife. I have been working in the field of urban planning and architectural design for over ten years and as a researcher for over five years. My recent work has concentrated on spatial analysis of socio-environmental relationships and environmental equity in urban contexts, utilizing remote sensing data and geospatial methodologies.

My tools of the trade include: R, Google Earth Engine (GEE), Shiny, Python, QGIS and Autodesk Revit.

I am always happy to hear from fellow researchers and planning professionals so please get in touch and we can get the conversation started, or better yet, if you are in Adelaide, we could meet for a coffee ☕ and a chat in person.

If you are interested in contacting me, I can always be reached by email at asheshwor[at]gmail.com.

### 👯 Looking to collaborate on the following research areas

-   Urban socio-environmental analysis in Australia, Nepal, Vietnam, South Korea and the Pacific Islands.
-   Socio-ecological research in developing regions.
